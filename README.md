# WaveScan Frontend
WaveScan Intern Assessment 2023

The dashboard first sends a GET request to the API for all the scanners information, and displays it on the home page.

Thereafter, a user would be able to create a project form request, which will also have data validation of the form.

Finally, the user will be able to see the scanners that match their criteria, which includes both scanning mode as well as the scanning frequency.

To test this, the user can first look at the list of all the scanners, and then decide on which scanning modes they would like to request, and then select them in the project form.
